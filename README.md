# image_scorify

**Bridging the gap between Machine Learning and Deep Learning!**

## Description

This package fills the gap between Machine Learning and Deep Learning modeling. It creates scores from images that can be used as features in a Machine Learning model. These scores such as the symmetry scoring provided in the package can be used to identify key elements of an image without having to *Deep Learn* any data. Small-Medium size data sets with complementary image sets can benefit from this package by potentially extending the feature space beyond what is provided in the original data set.
